# Go Web App Problems
## Intro

My name is Ray Mannion and I am a 3rd student at the Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying Software Development

In this repository you wiil find problems I was asked to complete for a data representation and query module.
The [problems](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-web-applications.html) are done using the Go programming language, which I am currently learning and deal with creating web applications.

In order for you to run these programs you will need to install the [GO](https://www.google.ie/?gws_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=SQvUWejfHOaXgAaL3JeoBA)
compiler on your computer.
## Run the code
Once you have installed the compiler, and have the files on your computer, open a command line of your choice. Next, navigate your way to the folder. Then run the command "go build" followed by the name of the go file(including the file extension) you wish to run. This will then create an executeable file of the same name, but with an ".exe" ententsion. Then simpily run the .exe file and the GO program will run. 

The first 4 Go files were used to learn about web application, but the file 05-cookie.go is the fully finished program.
## Playing the game
Once the program is running, open a browser of your choice and type localhost8080 into the address bar. This will display a page with the text guessing game. Then add /guess to the address and a second page is loaded.

Alternatively you can type localhost8080/guess, to go straight to the game.

On this page you will find a form. This allows the user to enter a number between 1 and 20. Once submitted, there guess is sent back to the program and a message is passed to the html file telling the user if the number is too high, too low or the right number.
